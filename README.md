Blog Website and Application

Building a blog website gives you a chance to tinker and better understand database relationships, user authentication, and how to build an attractive blog website. After all, the blog needs to be appealing to attract users, and users should be able to post their articles, come back and edit them when desired, and even delete them. Also, make sure to include the necessary authentication elements so that users with legitimate credentials can use the platform

CRUD
- Create -> create new article
- Read -> read all article, read one article
- update -> update all part of article
- delete -> delete article
